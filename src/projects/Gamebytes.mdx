What is a fantasy console? It emulates a fictitious video game console, and allows you to experience retro gaming without the need for the actual hardware. It’s a self contained game-system that works in technical specification set in by the developer, and comes with an editor to make your own games. 

Gamebytes specifically is going to be based off of the specifications from the original Gameboy system, so limited color palette, small pixel display, etc. For a better user experience, the fantasy console will be designed to run on a web page using JS React and HTML/CSS.
