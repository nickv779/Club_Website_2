subtitle: Fall 2025 has kicked off a brand new chapter for the "best coding club on campus"

Since the Dawn of Time, man has always fought the good fight. Not alone, but always with another. That was why the Roman Empire once stood, a testament of mankind's greatness when together. Alas, it ended like over 4 years ago. But from the ashes of greatness, even greater things to come. But, you may ask, at what point do we become our greatest? How will we know when we're at that point? How many story points will it take?

Suffice to say, we've already at our greatest.

Open Source Club, the "best coding club on campus", is back better than ever this Fall! With most of our projects not continuing from the Spring, this is the moment OSC reaches brand new heights, building upon the successes of our forefathers. To not disappoint those who came before, distinguished individuals from all over the world came to Pitch Day to pitch the next Facebook, or the next MySpace, or the next NVIDIA, or the next YouTube, or the next Netflix, or the next Whatsapp, or the next Uber, or the next iPhone, or even the next Roman Empire.

It was an incredible serious of pitches. From Nobel-qualified projects to the next step in evolution, none of the ideas were anything short of incredible. The crowds would cheer at every project, the room bolstering in laughter. Our president, Joseph 'Open Source' Malegni, put the day to words the best:

> Throughout my tenure as president of Open Source Club, never have I seen such able-bodied and determined minds come together to innovate together. I believe today's Pitch Day, the Holy C of all Pitch Days, is one to go down in the books in Open Source history. Linus Torvalds, the daddy of Linux, would think about today as he eats his breakfast every morning. I wonder what he eats for breakfast.

Unfortunately, not everyone can be the chosen one. Maybe only a few chosen ones, this isn't Lord of the Rings so who knows. But what is known, is that every project pitched could be the next FAANG or MANGO or whatever new acronym Linkedin chooses every other month. With that, OSC (short for Open Source Club I'm just using slang here) will host these next incredible initiatives:

1. Terminal Casino, where all your gambling dreams can come true all in your terminal! (not with real money)
2. StudyGatchi, where you can grow a little guy as long as you get your tasks done on time, or else...
3. r/place, bringing the gator community together to do some grafitti (legally)
4. OSC Workout App, because paywalls in current apps suck and we can do better!

With that, OSC (again short for Open Source Club it's just slang) will pave forward as history is being made, one pull request at a time.
