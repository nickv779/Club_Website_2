subtitle: When Nosferatu threatened the lands, it was the OSC minihackers who saved the day

I doubt you could even imagine it. That which commanded the stars. Giving life its fullest brilliance. Until Count Orlok a.k.a Nosferatu and his army of vampires threatened to rob it from the lands. It seemed like it would all go his way... until a certain coding club refused that fate.

Open Source Club, led by its president Joseph 'ArmCortexV8' Malegni, had to stop Nosferatu and his plans, lest all Computer Science majors as we knew it would perish. But how can Nosferatu be stopped? How can we refuse our fate, resist the unrelenting march towards the end? The answer was simple. OSC Minihack, the 2024 hackathon of legends, had to return. It was the only way we could protect *it* from Nosferatu. And by it, haha, well. Let's just say. Job security.

But it wasn't easy to plan. Nosferatu was too much of a threat for OSC to stop alone. But, luckily, there were those who would help. Astera Labs, known for their AI infrastructure and semiconductor work, and Andor, known for their healthcare AI solutions, came to OSC's aid and helped turn the tide of battle in our favor. As such, the OSC Minihack 2025 would begin with two challenges: the general prompt, and the Astera challenge.

The general prompt was to measurably improve the quality of life for an individual(s) while the Astera challenge was to build a product that reimagines what it means to be connected, using any form of AI to help people or systems interact in novel ways. But the hackathon ultimately wasn't all cupcakes and unicorns. It was a bloodbath.

When the clock hit start, everyone went running. The thousands of participants from every corner of the universe all went with their teams to create their projects. At first, the goal was just something cool enough to get a job, but the OSC minihackers dreamed even bigger. Some aimed to reproduce the notion of genetic instinct, the same way a bird can learn how to fly. Others worked to channel away the negative emotions a person can feel, dissipating their anger and frustration in a therapeutic fashion. Some of these teams were maxed at 4, and others sought to change the world solo. From first years who've never coded in their lives, to those who code like they're Lead Senior Manager Director Software Engineer XIV but are also like second year still.

Life isn't all about coding though, and despite the excitement and determination every minihacker exhibited, the OSC organizers still wanted everyone touching grass. But it was hard for a coding club of CS majors to tell CS majors to touch grass, so they called for backup... Dress to Impress Roblox social with the reputable fashion club UF MODE! Puppy social featuring 2 adorable dogs with the incredible Puppy Club! And, last but never least, the esteemed PC Building Club and the Gaming social!

But as the socials all ended and the night sky arrived, the minihackers had to trudge on to reach their finish goals. But many would've perish after long hours of coding, were it not for the generosity of Celsius to donate many drinks for the minihackers to consume. With that, the minihackers could battle on and reach the end.

And the end did arrive. With over 50 projects submitted, all were reviewed by a council of esteemed judges: Dr. Alexandre Gomes de Siqueira and Professor Michael Link who both teach Operating Systems. CpE masters student Christopher Tressler who, beloved by many, helped connect people together. Lastly, the legendary Anton Salvador, the OSC 2024-25 president, who returns to grace us with his wisdom once again.

After many long hours of debates and judging, 4 victors were chosen. 3 of the 4 would win the OSC top 3 prizes, while the 4th would be the sole Astera Challenge winner. With that said, the projects they succeeded at building are:

1. NextStep, winning 1st place, aimed to provide a job-prep copilot from AI resume polishing to daily Neetcode reminders, all so you can get a job!
2. PosturePal, winning 2nd place, with the sole goal of helping YOU keep track of your posture and make sure that back is straight, or else you in 40 years is going to be mad.
3. Eator, winning 3rd place, wanted to eliminate food waste by creating ways for people and organizations to advertise their leftover food, so students and others in need of a quick meal nearby are happy and the people who don't have to throw away the food anymore are also happy!
4. SkillPool, the Astera winner, defined the platform that can connect managers looking for the right fit to the most qualifying candidates, all in a single seamless and intuitive interface!

While only 4 winners could be chosen, that doesn't mean there were only 4 good projects. Every minihacker who attended had made a project to be proud of, and a project they could all show off at the UF career fair, happening immediately after the hackathon! Recruiters from all over will be impressed by the ingenuity and passion behind every single project that was made this weekend. Suffice to say, at least a few will be getting a job.

And that was how job security was protected againt Nosferatu, and how OSC ultimately defeated the wicked vampire lord, but not alone. Our many thanks goes to the many sponsors and individuals who helped make the OSC Minihack 2025 a proper successor to the original Minihack. For that reason alone, OSC is eternally grateful. And to all the people who trudged through the hackathon and poured their passion all weekend along:

Thank you for coming, and we hope you enjoyed. [Here were all the photos taken during the hackathon.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e5q7B2fnWKqDxbiMJf5RZfoVE2KkO6vv)
